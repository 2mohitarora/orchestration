Traffic Management
    https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/connect/manage-traffic
    Service Router -> Service Splitter -> Service Resolver
        Default service-router passes all routes to the same service
        Default service-splitter passes 100% of the traffic to the same service
        Default service-resolver selects all healthy instances from the local Consul Datacenter
        The results of this Discovery Chain will be pre-calculated in Consul and pushed into Envoyâ€™s dataplane configuration on proxy startup, so as to avoid the need for additional lookups once traffic starts
flowing through the sidecar proxy.
